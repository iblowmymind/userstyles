# (WIP) ActivelyDark

Makes [Actively Learn](https://www.activelylearn.com/) dark. (at least the homepage, as this isn't necessary in the reader itself because it supplies a good-enough dark theme)
I don't want my eyes to be blind. So, I wrote this.
Enjoy, for it will probably be of no use to you.

## Instructions

- Make sure you have Stylus ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)) installed, and then click on [this](https://github.com/iblowmymind/userstyles/raw/main/src/ActivelyDark/ActivelyDark.user.css) link to automatically set up and install the theme. Make sure you periodically check for updates.

## Mobile support

- Currently very experimental, mainly because I'm too lazy.
- Will need a way to inject userscripts into Safari or any other browser.

## Changelog

- 16.10.2022: Update to 0.0.1.0
