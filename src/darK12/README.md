# darK12

Makes K12Net dark.
I don't want my eyes to be blind. So, I wrote this.
Enjoy, for it will probably be of no use to you.

## Instructions
- Make sure you have Stylus ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)) installed, and then click on [this](https://github.com/iblowmymind/userstyles/raw/main/src/darK12/darK12.user.css) link to automatically set up and install the theme. Make sure you periodically check for updates.
## Mobile support
- Currently very experimental, mainly because I'm too lazy.
- Will need a way to inject userscripts into the K12Net mobile app (which is just a Web frame, so there might be a way), or in worst case scenario, run the whole thing in Safari.
